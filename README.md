# XLChartShift
Creates new chart with source data shifted by cells and/or rows

I had some Excel files that required several identical charts for similar data organized identically in columns.
I couldn't find this functionality natively in Excel so I set out to write what I thought would be a quick script in VBA.
It ended up teaching me a lot about coding and launching me into coding adventures to this day.
The biggest and unexpected problem was to extract data from a chart in Excel in order to replicate it with identical formatting while only changing the source data.
It works ok for my fairly specific needs and chart types but crashes easily with unexpected data and chart types.
Still amazed I couldn't find this functionality, is it out there and I just did find it?
I know readablity is poor, sorry this was my first project from years ago.
